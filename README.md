# Moonlight PC

[Moonlight PC](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source PC client for NVIDIA GameStream and [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine).

Moonlight also has mobile versions for [Android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).

You can follow development on our [Discord server](https://moonlight-stream.org/discord) and help translate Moonlight into your language on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/moonlight/moonlight-qt/).

# What this fork changes:
It is a personal fork that enhances UI and has some personal changes.
 - Made the UI much better looking by:
 - removing the top bar and unnecessary stuff
 - centered hosts and games
 - Made the UX better by upgrading how it works with the controller and HDMI CEC mapped remotes (via hwdb)
 - removed unnecessary stuff

## Features
 - Hardware accelerated video decoding on Windows, Mac, and Linux
 - H.264, HEVC, and AV1 codec support (AV1 requires Sunshine and a supported host GPU)
 - YUV 4:4:4 support (Sunshine only)
 - HDR streaming support
 - 7.1 surround sound audio support
 - 10-point multitouch support (Sunshine only)
 - Gamepad support with force feedback and motion controls for up to 16 players
 - Support for both pointer capture (for games) and direct mouse control (for remote desktop)
 - Support for passing system-wide keyboard shortcuts like Alt+Tab to the host
 
## Building

### Linux/Unix Build Requirements
* Qt 6 is recommended, but Qt 5.12 or later is also supported (replace `qmake6` with `qmake` when using Qt 5).
* GCC or Clang
* FFmpeg 4.0 or later
* Install the required packages:
  * Debian/Ubuntu:
    * Base Requirements: `libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopus-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libssl-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libva-dev libvdpau-dev libxkbcommon-dev wayland-protocols libdrm-dev`
    * Qt 6 (Recommended): `qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev libqt6svg6-dev qt6-wayland qml6-module-qtquick-controls qml6-module-qtquick-templates qml6-module-qtquick-layouts qml6-module-qtqml-workerscript qml6-module-qtquick-window qml6-module-qtquick`
    * Qt 5: `qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtquick-window2 qml-module-qtquick2 qtwayland5`
* Building the Vulkan renderer requires a `libplacebo-dev`/`libplacebo-devel` version of at least v7.349.0 and FFmpeg 6.1 or later.

### Docker containers
If you want to use Docker for building, look at [this repo](https://github.com/cgutman/moonlight-packaging) containing canonical containers
for different architectures, which handle building deps and extra linking for you.

### Build Setup Steps
1. Install the latest Qt SDK (and optionally, the Qt Creator IDE) from https://www.qt.io/download
    * You can install Qt via Homebrew on macOS, but you will need to use `brew install qt --with-debug` to be able to create debug builds of Moonlight.
    * You may also use your Linux distro's package manager for the Qt SDK as long as the packages are Qt 5.12 or later.
    * This step is not required for building on Steam Link, because the Steam Link SDK includes Qt 5.14.
2. Download submodules and dependencies
    * Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from within `moonlight-qt/`.
    * On Windows and macOS, you must also run `setup-deps.ps1` (Windows) or `setup-deps.py` (macOS).
    * Perform these steps each time you pull new changes from the Git repository.
3. Open the project in Qt Creator or build from qmake on the command line.
    * To build a binary for use on non-development machines, use the scripts in the `scripts` folder.
        * For Windows builds, use `scripts\build-arch.bat` and `scripts\generate-bundle.bat`. Execute these scripts from the root of the repository within a Qt command prompt. Ensure  7-Zip binary directory is on your `%PATH%`.
        * For macOS builds, use `scripts/generate-dmg.sh`. Execute this script from the root of the repository and ensure Qt's `bin` folder is in your `$PATH`.
        * For Steam Link builds, run `scripts/build-steamlink-app.sh` from the root of the repository.
    * To build from the command line for development use on macOS or Linux, run `qmake6 moonlight-qt.pro` then `make debug` or `make release`.
        * The final binary will be placed in `app/moonlight`.
    * To create an embedded build for a single-purpose device, use `qmake6 "CONFIG+=embedded" moonlight-qt.pro` and build normally.
        * This build will lack windowed mode, Discord/Help links, and other features that don't make sense on an embedded device.
        * For platforms with poor GPU performance, add `"CONFIG+=gpuslow"` to prefer direct KMSDRM rendering over GL/Vulkan renderers. Direct KMSDRM rendering can use dedicated YUV/RGB conversion and scaling hardware rather than slower GPU shaders for these operations.
